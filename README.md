## Latest Updates:

8/2/20 Version 21 of the dataset, we have refactored the full_dataset.tsv and full_dataset_clean.tsv files (since version 20) to include two additional columns: language and place country code (when available). This change now includes language and country code for ALL the tweets in the dataset, not only clean tweets. With this change we have removed the clean_place_country.tar.gz and clean_languages.tar.gz files. With our refactoring of the dataset generating code we also found a small bug that made some of the retweets not be counted properly, hence the extra increase on tweets available. Dailies have been added for 8/1, 7/31 and 7/30.

7/30/20 Daily data (under the /dailies/ folder) has been added for 7/29 and 7/28, note that some tweets will bleed into the following day due to different timezones captured.

7/28/20 Daily data (under the /dailies/ folder) has been added for 7/27 and 7/26, note that some tweets will bleed into the following day due to different timezones captured.

# Covid-19 Twitter chatter dataset for scientific use

Due to the relevance of the COVID-19 global pandemic, we are releasing our dataset of tweets acquired from the Twitter Stream related to COVID-19 chatter. The first 9 weeks of data (from January 1st, 2020 to March 11th, 2020) contain very low tweet counts as we filtered other data we were collecting for other research purposes, however, one can see the dramatic increase as the awareness for the virus spread. Dedicated data gathering started from March 11th yielding over 4 million tweets a day.

The data collected from the stream captures all languages, but the higher prevalence are:  English, Spanish, and French. We release all tweets and retweets on the full dataset, and a cleaned version with no retweets. There are several practical reasons for us to leave the retweets, tracing important tweets and their dissemination is one of them. For NLP tasks we provide the top 1000 frequent terms, the top 1000 bigrams, and the top 1000 trigrams. Some general statistics per day are included for both datasets.

We will continue to update the dataset every two days here and weekly in Zenodo.

# Usage 

All tweets ids found in full_dataset.tsv and full_dataset-clean.tsv need to be hydrated using a tool like get_metada.py from the Social Media Toolkit (SMMT) released by our lab or Twarc. 

Note: All the code in the /processing_code folder is provided as-is, it was used to generate the provided files from the source Tweet JSON files. Documentation will be gradually added for these scripts.
